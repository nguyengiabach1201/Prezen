## General Questions and Support

If you have questions about how to use Prezen, the best place to ask is in the [Discussions](https://github.com/nguyengiabach1201/Prezen/discussions). Anything that isn't a bug report should be posted as a dicussion instead.

## Bug Reports

When reporting a bug make sure to include information about which browser and operating system you are on as well as the necessary steps to reproduce the issue. If possible please include a link to a sample presentation where the bug can be tested.

## Pull Requests

You should follow these guildlines to keep Prezen's source code organized and ensure its readability:

- Should be submitted from a feature/topic branch (not your master)
- Should follow the coding style of the file you work in, most importantly:
    - Tabs to indent
    - Double-quoted strings
